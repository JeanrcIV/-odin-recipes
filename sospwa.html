        <p>Red, black, white, and green are just a few of the appellations we have for our beans. I could go deeper into the varieties. There are variations within each of those shades and colors. But I’ll refrain from doing so as I may get lost in the process.</p>

        <h1>Haitian Sos Pwa</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cup uncooked beans</li>
            <li>4½-5 cups water</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>½ bell pepper</li>
            <li>½ onion</li>
            <li>1 piment bouc</li>
            <li>1 thyme sprig</li>
            <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>ti salé or lardon optional</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter optional</li>
        </ul>


        <ol>
            <li>Soak the beans in water overnight or for at least three (3) hours</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, strain the beans</li>
            <li>Transfer to a pressure cooker</li>
 
            <li>Cover with water</li>
 
            <li>Add the garlic cloves and cook for about 20 minutes. Your beans should be fork tender at this point</li>
            <li>Once the beans are cooked, separate them in half</li>
            <li>Purée the first half using either a mortar and pestle or a blender. Add some of the cooking water to make the process easier</li>
            <li>Strain the obtained purée and discard the skin</li>
            <li>Mix the purée with the second half of preserved beans and the remaining water</li>
            <li>Season to taste</li>
            <li>Transfer to a pot.</li>
            <li>Add the bell pepper, onion, piment bouc, thyme and lardon (optional)</li>
            <li>Let simmer on low until your bean sauce thickens. The longer you leave it, the thicker your sòs pwa</li>
            <li>Finish with the butter (optional) and serve in a bowl</li>
            <li>Laddle your sòs pwa over some rice, mayi moulen (polenta) or millet, and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

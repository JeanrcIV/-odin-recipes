    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deep fryer</li>
        <li>Air Fryer</li>
        <li>Chefs Knife</li>
        <li>Plantain Press</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 plantains green or slightly yellow</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Juice from 1 lemon; Optional</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Deep Fry Version: Cut the skin along the ridges straight down the plantains. I recommend doing it in multiple places as it makes it easier to peel. Especially if this is your first time. Be careful to not go in too deep. About ½ inch or so. Just enough to lift the skin.
Cut the plantains into the desired size diagonally after peeling, then carefully transfer the plantain pieces to lukewarm water. 
Heat the oil: Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees. When the oil reaches temperature, use a spider spoon to carefully add the plantains to the oil in batches. Fry the plantains on all sides until golden. 
Remove the plantains from the deep fryer and place on a paper toweled plate to drain. Add the next batch. While the next batch is frying and the other plantains are still warm, use a plantain smasher to smash the plantains. 
Repeat the process as necessary. 
Fried Twice: For the second frying method, take about 2-3 of the smashed plantains add them to the water for about 30 seconds then refry them for about 1-2 minutes. Repeat the process as necessary with the remaining batch.  
Transfer the cooked/fried plantains onto a paper-toweled plate. Best serve with Pikliz.</p>
 
Air Fryer Green Plantains: To prepare the plantains in the air fryer, after the plantains are cut diagonally, soak them in the saltwater, place the plantains in the air fryer basket and spray them with olive oil. Cook them on 400 degrees for 15 minutes; shaking or turning halfway. 
When the 15 minutes are up, press the plantains, dip them in the water again for about 5 seconds. Spray them again with olive oil, then cook again for an additional 2 minutes or until desired crispiness (See notes below). This method also allows the plantains to be slightly crispy. 
I found that the plantains can become dry while cooking in the air fryer. I recommend spraying them as needed to help them cook better and end with a yellow/golden color when finished. 
Luckily, yellow plantains or maduros, are easier to handle than green plantains because they are softer. No need to soak them in the salted water, although some do soak them for extra flavor. No need to dip them in water after the first fry (some do as well). 
Yellow Plantains In The Air Fryer: To air-fry sweet plantains, cut the plantains into the desired size after peeling. Transfer the sweet plantains to the air fryer basket, and spray the plantains with olive oil. Air fry for 8-10 minutes at   375 degrees per side or until tender
